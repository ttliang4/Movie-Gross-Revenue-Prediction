Predicting the gross of top 1000 movies in IMDB

In today’s ever-evolving film industry, understanding the factors that influences a movie’s success can be very crucial for film-makers, producers and movie investors. One key metric used to assess a film’s success is its gross revenue, which not only reflects its financial success but also how well its been received by the general public. To predict a movie’s revenue before its release can offer valuable insight for the decision making process, aiding in resource allocation and strategic planning.
The aim of this project is to predict the gross revenue of films by analyzing the “IMDB Movies Dataset” from Kaggle. Using variables like genre, IMDB rating, runtime, certificate and other relevant factors to predict the gross revenue of movies. By analyzing these factors, we seek to identify patterns and correlations that contribute to a film’s financial success. Consequently, providing potentially useful insights for industry professionals involved in film production, distribution, and investment.
